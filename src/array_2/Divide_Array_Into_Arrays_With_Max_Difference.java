/*Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,4,8,7,9,3,5,1], k = 2
Output: [[1,1,3],[3,4,5],[7,8,9]]
Explanation: We can divide the array into the following arrays: [1,1,3], [3,4,5] and [7,8,9].
The difference between any two elements in each array is less than or equal to 2.
Note that the order of elements is not important.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,3,3,2,7,3], k = 3
Output: []
Explanation: It is not possible to divide the array satisfying all the conditions.*/
